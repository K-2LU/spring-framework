## Reason why I am doubling down on Java in late 2025
Java is a battle tested language for developing Enterprise level software. It has stood the test of time, and if learnt properly it can enable you to make reliable, scalable and secure applications relatively easily. Learning Java back 2021-2022 has been the single best decision of my short programming career. In In this age of vibe coders and AI dependent software developers it is important to hone your skills in something that makes you better as a programmer.   
Java will stay relevant as long as there is a demand for large scale enterprise level software.
