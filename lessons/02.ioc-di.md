## Inversion of Control(IoC) 
Inversion of control is a philosophical concept in programming. It means giving control of object creation and lifecycle to a separate party(usually a framework).    
We know Java is a OOP-based language, almost everything in Java has to do with objects(except primitives). So let's say for each controller, service, repository, we have to create separate classes for each entity. And we do not just create an object and let to loose, we have to control its entire lifecycle. Handling this can get quickly out of hand when your codebase has to handle hundreds of classes.    
In **IoC(Inversion of Control)**, we let a separate entity to handle lifecycle of objects. And **Dependency Injection** is the actual implementation of IoC.

## Dependency Injection(DI)
**Dependency Injection** is the practical implementation of **IoC**.
